The embedded flash memory resets FW when the corresponding operation has been acknowledged. Note: Using a force-write operation prevents the application from updating later the missing bits with something else than 1, because it is likely that it leads to permanent ECC error. Write forcing is effective only if the write buffer is not empty and was filled by non-secure access (in particular, FW does not start several write operations when the force-write operations are performed consecutively). Since there is just one write buffer, FW can force a write in bank1 or bank2."]
