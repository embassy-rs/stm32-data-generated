If the channel x is enabled (CH[x].CR.EN asserted) with TRIGPOL[1:0] = 00 or 11, these TRIGM[1:0] bits are ignored. Else, a LPDMA transfer is conditioned by at least one trigger hit: first burst read of a 2D/repeated block transfer is conditioned by one hit trigger. – If the peripheral is programmed as a source (DREQ = 0) of the LLI data transfer, each programmed burst read is conditioned. – If the peripheral is programmed as a destination (DREQ = 1) of the LLI data transfer, each programmed burst write is conditioned. The first memory burst read of a (possibly 2D/repeated) block, also named as the first ready FIFO-based source burst, is gated by the occurrence of both the hardware request and the first trigger hit. The LPDMA monitoring of a trigger for channel x is started when the channel is enabled/loaded with a new active trigger configuration: rising or falling edge on a selected trigger (TRIGPOL[1:0] = 01 or respectively TRIGPOL[1:0] = 10). The monitoring of this trigger is kept active during the triggered and uncompleted (data or link) transfer; and if a new trigger is detected then, this hit is internally memorized to grant the next transfer, as long as the defined rising or falling edge is not modified, and the TRIGSEL[5:0] is not modified, and the channel is enabled. Transferring a next LLIn+1 that updates the CH[x].TR2 with a new value for any of TRIGSEL[5:0] or TRIGPOL[1:0], resets the monitoring, trashing the memorized hit of the formerly defined LLIn trigger. After a first new trigger hitn+1 is memorized, if another second trigger hitn+2 is detected and if the hitn triggered transfer is still not completed, hitn+2 is lost and not memorized.memorized. A trigger overrun flag is reported (CH[x].SR.TOF =1 ), and an interrupt is generated if enabled (CH[x].CR.TOIE = 1). The channel is not automatically disabled by hardware due to a trigger overrun. Note: When the source block size is not a multiple of the source burst size and is a multiple of the source data width, then the last programmed source burst is not completed and is internally shorten to match the block size. In this case, if TRIGM[1:0] = 11 and (SWREQ =1  or (SWREQ = 0 and DREQ =0 )), the shortened burst transfer (by singles or/and by bursts of lower length) is conditioned once by the trigger. When the programmed destination burst is internally shortened by singles or/and by bursts of lower length (versus FIFO size, versus block size, 1-Kbyte boundary address crossing): if the trigger is conditioning the programmed destination burst (if TRIGM[1:0] = 11 and SWREQ = 0 and DREQ = 1), this shortened destination burst transfer is conditioned once by the trigger.",
